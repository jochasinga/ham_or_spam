    "## Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Albeit being arguably the simplest algorithm in machine learning, [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) is very powerful and practical in applications such as spam mail classification, recommendation system, and real-time prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) · P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation, $P$ stands for probability. $P(A)$ reads \"the probability of Event A occurring\" while $P(A|B)$ reads \"the probability of Event A occurring *provided* Event B happened.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a practical Bayes Theorem application to solve any parent's problem:\n",

    "> What is the chance that my kid will contract sickness if another kid she plays with has a sniffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `P(Sick)` stands for how often kids of the same age as that kid get sick in that given month, and `P(Sniffle)` for how often they have sniffles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: 20% of kids age 3-5 in California Bay Area are sick and contagious during any given month of November (`P(Sick) = 0.2`), but even more kids with sniffles (30%) (`P(Sniffle) = 0.3`). It's been known that 80% of all sick kids have sniffles (`P(Sniff|Sick) = 0.8`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(Sick|Sniff) = (P(Sniff|Sick) * P(Sick)) / P(Sniff)\n",
    "              = 0.8 * 0.2 / 0.3\n",
    "              = 0.16 / 0.3\n",
    "              = 0.53333...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided the kid has a sniffle, There is a **53%** chance that she will be sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the formula kind of tells us “forwards” when we know “backwards” (or vice versa).\n",
